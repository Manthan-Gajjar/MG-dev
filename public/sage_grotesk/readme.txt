Sage Grotesk - a sans serif typeface, containing 301 glyphs. Intended as a display but suitable for typesetting short texts. The inspiration for creating the font was the Space Grotesk typeface, which I really like to use, but I missed a slight twist in individual letters. Thick, wide, simple glyphs - intentionally resembling the bold version, very well take on the role of a headline font.
